Time Complexity:
-No. of basic operations such as +-*/, comparision, logical operators,assignment, accessing elements function calls are all counted for calculating time complexity.


• Mathematical formulas that just calculate an answer: O(1)
• Unordered set/map: O(1) per operation
• Binary search: O(log n)
• Ordered set/map or priority queue: O(log n) per operation
• Prime factorization of an integer, or checking primality or compositeness of an integer:O(√n)
• Reading in n items of input: O(n)
• Iterating through an array or a list of n elements: O(n)
• Sorting: usually O(n log n) for default sorting algorithms (mergesort and quicksort used in std::sort())
• Iterating through all subsets of size k of the input elements: O(pow(n,k))
For example, iterating through all triplets is O(pow(n,3)).
• Iterating through all subsets: O(pow(2,n))
• Iterating through all permutations: O(n!)
